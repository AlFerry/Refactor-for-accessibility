# Refactor-for-accessibility
Refactor existing code to improve accessibility without changing functionality

I changed all <div> elements to semantic HTML elements that better described what the code was doing.

I ensured all links on the page functioned properly.

I optimized the css file to combine repeated styles in order to make it easier to change the styling.

I added alt tags to all images for accessibility and a title to the background image since an alt tag cannot be added.

I added a descriptive title to the webpage.

I added comments describing the general function of parts of the code so it will be easier to edit for future developers.
